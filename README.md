# Barbell Path Tracker

## Motivation:
As a fitness enthusiast, I noticed that many beginners in the gym struggle to maintain proper form while doing weighted squats. One simple indicator would be a vertical path of the barbell while squatting. 

That application does exactly that. Built with **OpenCV**, it allows the user to visualise the path that their barbell takes as they squat. A relatively straight bar path often suggests proper technique.

## Extension
Moving forward, I am planning to include other factors that are indicators to good form as well like the knee and hip angle and spinal alignment while squatting. Iâ€™m currently expanding this project to analyze these metrics and provide individual scores for each, making the feedback more comprehensive and user-friendly.
